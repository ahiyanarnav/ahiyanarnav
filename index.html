            Fast-forward into the digital era, we are living at a time where
            exchange of physical assets for value has become largely a thing of
            the past. Currently the world is witnessing a radical shift in the
            financial system where digital assets are transferred directly and
            securely without intermediaries. Currently penned at 100M +
            transactions, Block chain technology is used regularly by millions
            of users around the globe to transact securely without hassles.
            <br />
            <br />
            Blockchain is not one single technology, but a group of technologies
            including Encryption & Hashing, P2P Network Program or the
            Blockchain protocol, implemented together for the exchange of
            digital assets. Blockchain technology runs on a peer-to-peer model,
            unlike many other applications on the WWW running on a client-server
            model. Provisioning of a distributed network minimizes the risk of
            corruption or the impact because of failure of one of the nodes.
            Blockchain technology has successfully formed a transaction layer
            for the internet, where users use high-security keys and shared
            layers to transact with each other securely.
